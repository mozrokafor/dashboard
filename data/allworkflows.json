That will be\r\nremoved anyways as soon as we more to Qt6.3 or above, because Qt will\r\nprovide the APIs we are currently getting from cppwinrt.\r\n\r\nThat code is only being called to add an extra key to a Glean event\r\nrecording, so this doesn't actually affect user facing features on the\r\napp.'","timestamp":"2022-12-20T11:23:40Z","author":{"name":"Beatriz Rizental","email":"beatriz.rizental@gmail.com"},"committer":{"name":"GitHub","email":"noreply@github.com"}},"runs":[{"name":"Unit Tests","html_url":"https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/mozilla-vpn-client/actions/runs/3740037199","display_title":"VPN-3512 -
