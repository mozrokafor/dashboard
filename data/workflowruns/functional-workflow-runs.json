For cached tasks however, that means reusing\r\nindex lookups that can be out of date by the time relpro runs, and\r\nrequiring a new push to pick up rebuilt cached tasks.  By listing the\r\ncached kinds in rebuild-kinds, we force new index lookups at release\r\npromotion time, to pick up e.g. new docker images without an extra
