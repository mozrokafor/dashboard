it\r\n\r\nThe version of cppwinrt that we use is v2.0.200609.3\r\nand it comes from Windows SDK 10.0.19041.0.\r\n\r\nThat version of cppwinrt has a bug for suppoting C++20,\r\nwhich is fixed on version 2.0.200921.6.\r\n\r\nIt's unclear wheather it is safe for us to update to a Windows SDK\r\nversion that includes the correct version of cppwinrt, because that\r\nwould require us to be on a Windows 11 SDK. We are unsure whether\r\nbuilding with that will result in binaries that can also be run on\r\nWindows 10.\r\n\r\nAfter speaking to Basti, we decided the least problematic way to address\r\nthis is to simply remove the code that relies on cppwinrt. That will be\r\nremoved anyways as soon as we more to Qt6.3 or above, because Qt will\r\nprovide the APIs we are currently getting from cppwinrt.\r\n\r\nThat code is only being called to add an extra key to a Glean event\r\nrecording, so this doesn't actually affect user facing features on the\r\napp.'","timestamp":"2022-12-20T11:23:40Z","author":{"name":"Beatriz
